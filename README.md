# OpenCall

An open-source, self-hostable rundown and show-calling app for live event production.

Producers build a minute-by-minute rundown of a show (corporate keynotes, conferences, sport presentation, broadcasts), then run it live while the whole crew follows along in real time on their own devices: cascading cue timing, anchored hard times, over/under tracking, per-role highlighting with a personal "you're on next" bar, speaker timers, a synced teleprompter, and read-only guest links.

## What it does today

- **Rundown editor** — collaborative real-time grid (every edit syncs live to every open screen), cascade timing with fixed start times set by double-clicking, milestones, section banners, row colours, hidden/muted durations, undo/redo over every row edit, per-user column visibility, boundary-transfer column resizing (edges stay pinned), and rename-on-double-click column headers.
- **Run sheets in** — import XLSX / XLS / CSV / **PDF** run sheets with a full-length mapping preview: columns keep the sheet's own names and order, wrapped PDF rows merge back into one row per item, roles (WHO/ROLE columns) are detected and colour-coded, alternate-ending blocks (win / lose / golden point) tag themselves from their banners, and a fix-it list repairs unparseable cells with context. "Update import" re-reads the stored sheet with the latest pipeline in one click.
- **Show calling** — start/pause/advance a live show; the active cue row grows with a CUE badge and a full-cell progress sweep, a big dead-centre timer counts the item (green/amber/red), skipped rows drop out of timing, and edits ripple: changing a duration or a start time shifts every fixed time below it (one undo reverses all of it). A timing check explains, in plain words, every place a sheet's times and durations disagree — and fixes the whole chain in one action.
- **Runs itself when it must** — server-driven clock-follow advances the show along the TIME column with every console closed (the live fail-safe); the showcaller stays in charge on the fly. A pre-show walkthrough mode steps a shared highlight through the sheet on every device before the show starts.
- **Sport-aware endings** — events can carry a sport (NRL first): at full time the console offers Win / Lose / ⚡ Golden point, golden point loops back to a final Win / Lose / Draw pick, and the chooser pulses as the decision point approaches (position-based, so stoppage time never breaks it).
- **Crew screens** — `/show` (full console), `/edit` (content only), `/view` (read-only), plus `/follow`, `/timer`, and `/prompter` companion surfaces. Everyone can pick "my role" (several at once) for personal highlights and an on-air countdown bar.
- **Access control** — admin token, per-company showcaller tokens, per-user email+password accounts with grants (admin / company / event / view-only), a self-service account page, and per-rundown join codes that carry the holder's name and revoke instantly. View grants get read-only documents, enforced server-side.
- **Operations** — event companies → events → rundowns hierarchy, archive, templates, snapshots and in-place restore, as-run show reports (CSV), guest passes with column filtering, DST-correct event-timezone clocks chosen from a worldwide dropdown, print/PDF/CSV export, and a server-kept error log reviewable from the admin dashboard.

The product spec lives in [BUILD_PROMPT.md](BUILD_PROMPT.md); the realtime protocol in [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md); the data model in [docs/DATA-MODEL.md](docs/DATA-MODEL.md); history in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Layout

- `packages/core` — pure timing engine (cascade, anchor flags, back-timing, mute) + import parsing + format helpers. Zero dependencies.
- `packages/protocol` — Zod schemas for the versioned WebSocket protocol.
- `packages/db` — Drizzle schema, Postgres/PGlite client, Yjs rundown document builder/projector, seed script.
- `apps/sync` — the server: HTTP management API, WebSocket show channel (`/`), and Yjs document sync (`/doc`) on **one port**.
- `apps/web` — Next.js app (admin dashboard, console, and companion surfaces).

## Quickstart (local development)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test          # timing engine, import parsing, protocol, doc round-trip, show state machine
pnpm seed          # seeds a demo rundown (embedded PGlite; set DATABASE_URL for Postgres)
pnpm dev           # web on :3000, sync on :8787
```

No database service is needed for development — an embedded PGlite database lives in `.pglite/`. Without `ADMIN_TOKEN` set the server runs **dev-open** (every request is treated as admin). Never expose a dev-open server to the internet.

## Self-hosting

OpenCall is two services plus a database:

| Piece | What it is | Port | Health check |
|---|---|---|---|
| **web** | Next.js frontend | 3000 | `GET /` → 200 |
| **sync** | HTTP API + show WebSocket (`/`) + doc WebSocket (`/doc`) — one port | 8787 (or `PORT`) | `GET /me` → `{"role":null}` when locked |
| **PostgreSQL** | data store (versioned migrations apply automatically at boot — no manual step) | 5432 | `pg_isready` |

### Environment variables

**sync** (runtime):

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes in production | Postgres connection string. Unset → embedded PGlite in `.pglite/` (single machine, dev only). |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN` | **yes in production** | Locks the deployment. Any long random string (e.g. `oc_admin_$(openssl rand -hex 20)`). Unset = dev-open: **everyone is admin**. |
| `ALLOW_DEV_JOIN` | set to `0` in production | Disables the `DEV123` local-dev join code. |
| `PORT` | optional | Listen port (default 8787). |

**web** (build-time — these are baked into the browser bundle, so changing them requires a rebuild):

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SYNC_HTTP_URL` | `https://<sync-host>` — the sync server URL browsers can reach |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SYNC_WS_URL` | `wss://<sync-host>` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOC_WS_URL` | `wss://<sync-host>/doc` |
| `PORT` | `3000` (runtime) |

Use `https://`/`wss://` in production and make sure your proxy/host **passes WebSocket upgrades** through to the sync service.

### Option A — Docker Compose (any VPS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertcmorton/opencall.git && cd opencall
# Edit docker-compose.yml: set the three NEXT_PUBLIC_* build args to the
# public URL of your sync host, and change the Postgres password. Then:
export ADMIN_TOKEN="oc_admin_$(openssl rand -hex 20)"   # save this — it is the admin login
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose run --rm seed    # optional demo data
```

Put TLS in front (Caddy, nginx, Traefik) of ports 3000 (web) and 8787 (sync, **with WebSocket upgrade enabled**).

### Option B — a PaaS (Railway, Render, Fly, …)

Create three services from this repo:

1. **PostgreSQL** — the platform's managed Postgres.
2. **sync** — build `pnpm --filter @opencall/sync build`, start `pnpm --filter @opencall/sync start`, root directory = repo root. Set `DATABASE_URL` (reference the managed Postgres), `ADMIN_TOKEN`, `ALLOW_DEV_JOIN=0`. Most platforms inject `PORT` — the server honours it. Give it a public domain.
3. **web** — build `pnpm --filter @opencall/web build`, start `pnpm --filter @opencall/web start`, root directory = repo root. Set the three `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables to the sync service's public domain (they must be present **at build time**) plus `PORT=3000`. Give it a public domain.

The sync server applies its bundled migrations on boot, so a fresh database initialises itself and upgrades apply automatically — there is no migration command to run.

### Option C — bare Node on a server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertcmorton/opencall.git && cd opencall
corepack enable && pnpm install
NEXT_PUBLIC_SYNC_HTTP_URL=https://sync.example.com \
NEXT_PUBLIC_SYNC_WS_URL=wss://sync.example.com \
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOC_WS_URL=wss://sync.example.com/doc \
pnpm --filter @opencall/web build
# run both under your process manager (systemd, pm2):
DATABASE_URL=postgres://… ADMIN_TOKEN=… ALLOW_DEV_JOIN=0 \
  PUBLIC_WEB_URL=https://app.example.com \
  pnpm --filter @opencall/sync start
PORT=3000 pnpm --filter @opencall/web start
```

`PUBLIC_WEB_URL` is where invitation links point. The sync server is a separate
service on a separate host and cannot work out the app's address by looking at
itself, so without this it falls back to the `Origin` of whichever browser
created the invitation — meaning an admin working from a staging URL or an IP
address mints links to *that*, and they go out by email to people with no way
of telling. Set it.

Email is optional: `SMTP_HOST` and `SMTP_FROM` (plus `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`,
`SMTP_PASSWORD` if your relay wants them) turn on sending invitations. With no
mail server the invitation is still created and the dashboard hands you the
link to pass on however you already reach your crew. See `.env.example`.

Requires Node 20+ and pnpm 9+. Reverse-proxy `https://app.example.com` → :3000 and `https://sync.example.com` → :8787 (WebSocket upgrades on).

### First run

1. Open the web URL → **Admin dashboard** → paste your `ADMIN_TOKEN` at the gate.
2. Create an **event company** (its token is the showcaller credential for that company), then events and rundowns — or import a run sheet straight from XLSX/CSV/PDF.
3. Create **users** under *Users & access* in the sidebar (admin-only): give each an email, a password, and grants — full admin, one company, one event, or view-only. They sign in with email + password on the landing page (each also gets a personal `usr_…` backup token).
4. For per-show crew access without accounts, use a rundown's *View-only links* panel: **Copy view-only link** hands camera operators and crew a URL that opens the rundown read-only, and a six-character code from the same panel can be typed on the landing page instead. Both are **view-only, and that is the only kind there is** — calling or editing a show takes an account with a password, because a code is a thing that gets photographed off a wall and forwarded out of a group chat, and neither should end with a stranger holding the transport.
5. Check *Error log* in the admin sidebar occasionally — server, process, and browser errors all land there.

### Verify a deployment

```bash
curl -s https://<sync-host>/me                      # → {"role":null}   (locked; {"role":"admin","devOpen":true} means NOT locked)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" https://<sync-host>/me   # → {"role":"admin"}
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://<web-host>/             # → 200
```

Open a rundown in two browser windows and type in a cell — the edit should appear in both within a second (proves the `/doc` WebSocket). The status dots in the rundown header show `doc` and `show` connectivity.

## Deploying with an AI assistant

This repository is written so that an AI coding assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot Workspace, etc.) can deploy it end-to-end. If you are an AI assistant: the **Self-hosting** section above is the specification — follow Option A, B, or C depending on what the user has, and finish with the **Verify a deployment** checks; nothing outside this README is required for a deployment.

A prompt you can paste into your assistant:

> Deploy the open-source app OpenCall (https://github.com/robertcmorton/opencall) on <my VPS / Railway / Render / Fly>. Follow the README's Self-hosting section. It is a pnpm/Turborepo monorepo with two services — `apps/web` (Next.js, port 3000) and `apps/sync` (HTTP + two WebSocket paths on one port, default 8787) — plus PostgreSQL. Versioned migrations apply automatically when the sync service boots; there is no manual migration step. Generate a strong ADMIN_TOKEN, set ALLOW_DEV_JOIN=0, and set the three NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables on the web build to the sync service's public https/wss URL. Make sure WebSocket upgrades are proxied to the sync service. When done, run the README's "Verify a deployment" curl checks, confirm `/me` returns {"role":null} without the token, and hand me the web URL and the ADMIN_TOKEN you generated.

Notes that save assistants time:

- The three `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are **build-time** for the web app; setting them after the build does nothing — rebuild.
- One port serves the sync HTTP API and *both* WebSocket paths (`/` and `/doc`); a proxy that strips upgrade headers breaks live sync while curl checks still pass.
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` unset is dev-open (**every visitor is admin**) — acceptable only on localhost.
- Watch out for per-service "watch paths" on PaaS builders: changes under `packages/*` affect both services; rebuild both when in doubt.
- The repo's Dockerfiles (`apps/*/Dockerfile`) and `docker-compose.yml` exist for Option A; PaaS builders can use their native Node builders instead — both work.
